# 1. Introduction & Vision

## 1.1 Project Definition

Miktós is a web-based intelligent AI development platform that combines multi-model AI orchestration with an integrated code editor. It provides developers with a unified environment to leverage the strengths of various AI models while maintaining a seamless coding workflow.

## 1.2 Project Name Origin

The name "Miktós" is derived from the Ancient Greek word μικτός (miktós), meaning "mixed" or "hybrid". It stems from the verb μίγνυμι (mígnumi), "to mix" [Ref: Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon, 9th ed., Oxford University Press].

This name encapsulates the core philosophy and technical approach of the platform, which involves:
- **Mixing Models**: Integrating and orchestrating a diverse range of AI models from various providers (e.g., Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT) within a single, unified interface.
- **Mixing Criteria**: Employing intelligent routing logic that considers a mixture of factors -- including task requirements, model capabilities, cost, performance, user preferences, and context -- to select the optimal AI model for any given request.
- **Mixing Techniques**: Reflecting the potential future integration of hybrid AI approaches, blending techniques like symbolic reasoning with neural network pattern recognition for more nuanced and robust decision-making.
- **Mixing Development & AI Assistance**: Combining conversational AI interfaces with integrated code editing and execution environments to create a seamless development workflow that eliminates context switching.

## 1.3 The Challenge: AI Model Complexity & Fragmentation

The landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models, is expanding at an unprecedented rate. Organizations, developers, and individual users face significant challenges in navigating this complex ecosystem:

- **Model Proliferation**: A vast and growing number of AI models are available from multiple cloud providers, specialized AI companies, and open-source communities. Each possesses unique strengths, weaknesses, context window limitations, and performance characteristics, making optimal selection difficult.
- **Cost Management**: Utilizing state-of-the-art models via APIs incurs significant operational costs. Inefficient model selection or lack of optimization leads to unpredictable expenses and impacts ROI.
- **Skill Fragmentation**: Developers must learn multiple interfaces, prompt strategies, and model-specific techniques, creating a steep learning curve and inefficiencies.
- **Context Switching**: Working with AI assistants typically requires moving between different tools (AI chat interfaces, code editors, terminal environments), disrupting workflow and cognitive focus.

## 1.4 The Miktós Vision

Miktós aims to solve these challenges by creating a unified platform that:

1. **Simplifies AI Complexity**: Abstracts away the technical details of individual models behind an intelligent orchestration layer that routes queries to the most appropriate AI model based on the task, context, and user preferences.

2. **Eliminates Context Switching**: Integrates AI assistance directly into the development workflow through a seamless code editor with built-in conversation capabilities.

3. **Optimizes Costs & Performance**: Intelligently selects models based on cost-efficiency and performance metrics, giving users control over their AI expenditure while maximizing output quality.

4. **Enhances Developer Productivity**: Provides a consistent interface with powerful features specifically designed for software development tasks, reducing the time spent switching between tools and learning different systems.

5. **Builds Community**: Creates an open ecosystem where developers can share, collaborate, and build upon each other's work through plugins, extensions, and knowledge sharing.

By realizing this vision, Miktós will empower developers to harness the full potential of AI assistance without the current fragmentation, complexity, and inefficiency of the existing ecosystem.

## 1.5 Project Goals & Success Metrics

The primary goals of the Miktós project are:

1. **Technical Excellence**: Create a high-performance, reliable platform with seamless integration between AI orchestration and code editing capabilities.

2. **User Adoption**: Achieve significant adoption within the developer community by providing measurable productivity improvements.

3. **Open Ecosystem**: Foster an active community of contributors and extension developers around the platform.

4. **Sustainable Business Model**: Establish a viable financial foundation through a combination of open-source and premium features.

These goals will be measured through specific metrics, including:
- Active user growth and retention rates
- Contribution activity from the open-source community
- User productivity improvements (measured through surveys and usage analytics)
- Cost savings compared to using individual AI services directly

## 1.6 Target Audience

Miktós is primarily designed for:

- **Software Developers**: Professional and hobbyist programmers seeking to integrate AI assistance into their workflow
- **Technical Teams**: Development teams looking for a unified solution for AI-assisted coding
- **AI Enthusiasts**: Individuals exploring the capabilities of different AI models
- **Technical Educators**: Teachers and students in programming and AI courses

The platform will scale from individual users to enterprise teams, with features and pricing structures appropriate for each segment.
